# Let S be a string containing only letters of the English alphabet. 

# An anagram of S is any string that contains exactly the same letters as S (with the same number of occurrences for each letter), but in a different order. 

# For example, the word kick has anagrams such as kcik and ckki.

# Now, let S[i]
# be the i-th letter in S. We say that an anagram of S, A, is shuffled if and only if for all i, S[i]â‰ A[i]. So, for instance, 

# kcik is not a shuffled anagram of kick as the first and fourth letters of both of them are the same. 
# However, ckki would be considered a shuffled anagram of kick, as would ikkc.

# Given an arbitrary string S, output any one shuffled anagram of S or else print IMPOSSIBLE if this cannot be done.

# Input

# The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. 

# T test cases follow. 

# Each test case consists of one line, a string of English letters.

# Output

# For each test case, output one line containing 
# Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is a shuffled anagram of the string for that test case, 
# or IMPOSSIBLE if no shuffled anagram exists for that string.
