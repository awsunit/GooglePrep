// You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

// Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.


// Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
// Output: [9,7,8]
// Explanation:
// The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
// This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
// A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
// Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
